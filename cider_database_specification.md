# The Fellowship of the Cider - Cider Database Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the data structure and initial population of the cider database for "The Fellowship of the Cider" application. The specification is derived from the `functional_specification.md`, `cider_research.md`, and `ciders_from_list_wiki.md`.

This revision incorporates feedback to better define sub-styles, represent flavor profiles as a 2D graph, and separate core cider data from user-specific logs.

## 2. Data Model Overview

The data model is now split into three main entities to clearly distinguish between the global catalog, a user's discovered ciders, and their individual tasting logs:

*   **Cider**: A global catalog of all ciders, containing objective information. This is the "undiscovered" list.
*   **UserDiscoveredCider**: A linking table that represents a user's personal collection of "unlocked" ciders.
*   **CiderLog**: A user's personal record of tasting a specific cider, including subjective ratings and context.

## 3. Cider Data Structure (Global Catalog)

Each cider in the global database will have the following metadata fields.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cider_id` | UUID | Unique identifier for each cider. | `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479` |
| `name` | String | The name of the cider. | `Angry Orchard Crisp Apple` |
| `brand` | String | The brand or producer of the cider. | `Angry Orchard` |
| `style` | Enum | The main style of the cider. See Section 7. | `Modern` |
| `sub_style` | Enum | A more specific style category. See Section 8. | `American Craft` |
| `origin_country` | String | The country of origin. | `USA` |
| `origin_region` | String | The region of origin. | `New York` |
| `abv` | Float | Alcohol by volume. | `5.0` |
| `rarity` | Enum | The rarity tier of the cider. See Section 9. | `Common` |
| `base_attack` | Integer | Base attack stat for the battle system. | `10` |
| `base_defense` | Integer | Base defense stat for the battle system. | `5` |
| `special_move` | String | A special move for the battle system. | `Crisp Apple Strike` |
| `flavor_coordinates` | Object | X/Y coordinates on the flavor graph. See Section 4. | `{ "x": 0.8, "y": -0.3 }` |
| `color` | String | The color of the cider. | `Golden` |
| `clarity` | Enum | The clarity of the cider. | `Clear` |
| `carbonation` | Enum | The carbonation level of the cider. | `Highly Carbonated` |
| `package_type` | Enum | The type of packaging. See Section 11. | `Bottle` |
| `description` | Text | A brief description of the cider. | `A classic American hard cider.` |
| `image_url` | String | A URL to an image of the cider. | `https://example.com/angry_orchard.png` |

### Battle Stat Determination

The `base_attack`, `base_defense`, and `special_move` fields are manually curated and not automatically generated. Their values are determined by conducting in-depth research into each cider's history, production methods, and cultural context. For example, a cider with a long history of being enjoyed by soldiers might have a higher `base_defense`, while a cider made with a rare, potent apple variety might have a powerful `special_move`.

## 4. Flavor Profile Graph

The `flavor_coordinates` field represents a cider's position on a 2D flavor graph.

*   **X-Axis (Sweetness):** Ranges from `-1.0` (Very Dry) to `1.0` (Very Sweet).
*   **Y-Axis (Complexity):** Ranges from `-1.0` (Simple/One-dimensional) to `1.0` (Complex/Multi-layered).
*   **UI Guidance:** The user interface should provide contextual help or examples to clarify the meaning of "Simple" vs. "Complex". For example, "Simple" ciders have a straightforward, single-note flavor (e.g., just apple), while "Complex" ciders have multiple layers of flavor and aroma (e.g., notes of oak, spice, and different fruits).

| Quadrant | Description |
|---|---|
| **Top-Right (X > 0, Y > 0)** | Sweet & Complex (e.g., Ice Ciders, Fine Perries) |
| **Top-Left (X < 0, Y > 0)** | Dry & Complex (e.g., Traditional Farmhouse, Wild Ferments) |
| **Bottom-Right (X > 0, Y < 0)** | Sweet & Simple (e.g., Mass-market Ciders) |
| **Bottom-Left (X < 0, Y < 0)** | Dry & Simple (e.g., Basic Dry Ciders) |

## 5. UserDiscoveredCider Data Structure (Linking Table)

## 9. Adding a New Cider to the Global Catalog

If a user discovers a cider that is not in the global `Cider` table, they can add it. The process is as follows:

1.  The user searches for the cider and no results are found.
2.  The user is prompted to "Add a New Cider to the Global Catalog".
3.  A form is presented with all the fields from the `Cider` table (Section 3).
4.  The user fills in the metadata for the new cider.
5.  Upon submission, the new cider is added to the global `Cider` table and is immediately available to all users.
6.  A new entry is created in the `UserDiscoveredCider` table for the user and the new cider.
7.  The user is then taken to the standard logging screen to create the first `CiderLog` entry for this new cider.

## 10. Automated Awards System (Tankards & Tags)

The system will automatically award `SpecialTankards` and `EvolutionTags` based on the data in a `CiderLog` and the user's overall history. These awards are stored in the `CiderLog` table for each specific log entry.

### Special Tankards

| **First Discovery Tankard** | Awarded to the very first `CiderLog` entry for a user. |
| **Century Tankard** | Awarded on the 100th unique cider discovered (i.e., the 100th entry in `UserDiscoveredCider`). |

| **Traveler's Tankard** | Awarded to the first log from each new country. |
| **Crystal Tankard** | Awarded to any log of a cider with `rarity` of `Epic` or higher. |
| **Ancient Relic Tankard** | Awarded to any log of a cider with `style` of `Traditional`. |
| **Collector's Tankard** | Awarded to any log of a cider with `rarity` of `Mythical` or `Artifact`. |
| **Fellowship Tankard** | Awarded to a log with a `venue_type` of `Pub` or `Bar` and a high rating (e.g., > 8). |
| **Solo Quest Tankard** | Awarded to a log with a `venue_type` of `Home` and a high rating (e.g., > 8). |
| **Broken Tankard** | Awarded to any log with a `personal_rating` of 1 or 2. |
| **Legendary Mithril Tankard** | Awarded to any log with a `personal_rating` of 10. |
| **Redemption Tankard** | Awarded to a log if the same cider was previously rated much lower (e.g., 3+ points lower). |

### Evolution Tags
| Tag Name | Triggering Event |
|---|---|
| **Home Guardian** | Awarded to a log if the user has logged 5+ ciders with a `venue_type` of `Home`. |

| **Festival Champion** | Awarded to a log if the `venue_type` is `Festival`. |
