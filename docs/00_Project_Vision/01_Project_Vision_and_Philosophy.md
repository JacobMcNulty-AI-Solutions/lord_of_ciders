## 4.6 Battle System Mechanics Framework (Collection-to-Combat Metaphor)

### 4.6.1 Battle System Philosophy: Collection Completion as Final Boss
The battle system serves as the strategic personality layer for personal cider collection, where each logged cider becomes a tactical asset in your progression toward the ultimate final boss challenge - representing complete global cider collection mastery.

**Core Battle Philosophy:**
- **Collection-Driven Power**: More logged ciders = more tactical options and strategic combinations
- **Final Boss = Collection Complete**: Ultimate challenge only accessible with comprehensive global coverage
- **Progressive Power Growth**: Battle capabilities strengthen with collection breadth and depth
- **Real Knowledge Integration**: Battle success reflects actual understanding of cider characteristics
- **Strategic Learning Tool**: Combat mechanics teach relationships between styles, regions, and quality tiers

### 4.6.2 Cider Combat Statistics Framework
**Base Combat Stats Derived from Cider Characteristics:**
- **Sweetness** (Offensive Power): Residual sugar content determines primary attack strength (0-15 scale)
- **Complexity** (Special Attack): Flavor layer depth and aromatic intensity for tactical abilities (1-10 scale)
- **Alcohol Strength** (Speed/Priority): ABV determines action order and critical pour chances (2-20% range)
- **Body** (Defense): Mouthfeel density and tannin structure for damage resistance (Light/Medium/Full scale)
- **Rarity** (HP/Staying Power): Production exclusivity and availability determines battle endurance (Common → Artifact tiers)

**Combat Stat Calculation Framework:**
```
Base Attack = (Sweetness × 4) + Rarity Modifier
Base Defense = Body Rating × 8 + Evolution Tag Bonuses
Speed = Alcohol Strength × 5 + Style Priority Modifier
Special Attack = Complexity × 6 + Regional Technique Bonus
HP = Rarity Tier × 15 + Fellowship Count Bonus
```

### 4.6.3 Cider Type Effectiveness Matrix (Flavor Profile Combat)
**Primary Cider Types:**
- **Traditional** (Classic apple-only fermentation)
- **Fruit-Forward** (Apple with additional fruits)
- **Funky/Wild** (Wild fermentation, brett character)
- **Ice/Dessert** (Concentrated sweetness, high residual sugar)
- **Hopped** (Hop-forward like beer crossover)
- **Spiced/Herb** (Botanical additions, unique ingredients)

**Orc Beer Enemy Types:**
- **Goblin Lagers** (Light, mass-produced, tutorial enemies)
- **Uruk Ales** (Strong hoppy beers, aggressive attacks)
- **Nazgûl Stouts** (Dark, complex, drain-based attacks)
- **Balrog IPAs** (Extreme hop bitterness, fire damage)
- **Sauron Imperial** (Final boss: combines all beer styles)

**Type Effectiveness Examples:**
- **Traditional beats Goblin Lagers** (Heritage trumps mass production): 2x damage
- **Funky/Wild beats Nazgûl Stouts** (Wild fermentation chaos disrupts dark complexity): 1.5x damage
- **Ice/Dessert weak to Balrog IPAs** (Sweetness overpowered by extreme bitterness): 0.5x damage
- **Hopped neutral vs Uruk Ales** (Similar hop profiles cancel out): 1x damage

### 4.6.4 Evolution Tags and Abilities Framework
**Context-Based Evolution Tags (Earned through specific logging scenarios):**
- **"Barrel-Aged"**: Logged aged/vintage ciders → +2 Complexity, +1 Body, special "Oak Finish" move
- **"Festival-Born"**: Logged at cider festivals → +1 Speed, "Crowd Favorite" team-wide buff ability
- **"Orchard-Direct"**: Logged at cider producers → +2 Attack, "Terroir Strike" ignores type resistance
- **"Battle-Tested"**: Cider revived after defeat → +1 all stats permanently, "Phoenix Pour" resurrection move
- **"Fellowship-Bearer"**: High re-log count → "Brotherhood Brew" boosts entire team when deployed

**Rare Evolution Paths:**
- **"Ancient Variety"** (heritage apples): Unlock special moves based on historical varieties
- **"Master Blended"** (complex blends): Can use multiple type effectiveness simultaneously  
- **"Ice-Forged"** (ice ciders): Immune to burn status, double damage in winter battles
- **"Wild-Heart"** (wild fermentation): Random type changes each turn, unpredictable but powerful

### 4.6.5 Turn-Based Combat Mechanics
**Battle Structure:**
- **Team Setup**: Select 6-cider arsenal, 1 active combatant, 5 reserves
- **Turn Options**: 
  1. **Pour Attack**: Primary damage using active cider's signature move
  2. **Tasting Defense**: Reduce damage, analyze opponent, build power for next turn
  3. **Cellar Switch**: Swap to different cider from reserve arsenal
  4. **Special Technique**: Use evolution tag abilities or regional signature moves

**Damage Calculation Framework:**
```
Base Damage = [(Attack Stat × Move Power × STAB × Type Effectiveness) / Defense Stat] × Random(0.85-1.0)
Critical Pour = ABV% chance × 1.5 damage multiplier
Status Effects = Applied based on cider characteristics and move properties
```

### 4.6.6 Collection-to-Battle Integration Mechanics
**Progressive Power Through Collection:**
