# Research Brief: Offline Capability & Data Sync Strategy

## Project Introduction: The Fellowship of the Cider - An Epic Journey of Cider Discovery

"The Fellowship of the Cider" is not just another logging app; it's a **gamified mobile application** designed to transform the simple act of trying ciders into an **epic medieval fantasy adventure**, deeply inspired by the rich lore of **Lord of the Rings**. Our core vision is to create a compelling, long-term engagement loop that encourages real-world cider exploration while providing a rich, immersive experience.

**Core Purpose**: To be the ultimate personal cider logging and documentation app, evolving into a comprehensive "cider dictionary" and gamifying the discovery process through unique mechanics.

**Key Gamified Mechanics**:
*   **Cider Logging & Rating**: Document every cider with detailed notes and a unique "tankard" rating system.
*   **Rarity System**: Discover and collect ciders across tiers from Common to Mythical/Artifact.
*   **Battle System**: Engage in "Pokemon-style" turn-based combat against "Orc beers" using your collected ciders.
*   **Quest & Achievement Systems**: Undertake weekly challenges and earn prestigious titles and rewards.
*   **Seven Rings of Cider**: Progress through a unique "ring" system tied to geographic exploration, style mastery, and battle victories.

This research is foundational to building the immersive and rewarding experience we envision.

## Research Area: Offline Capability & Data Sync Strategy

### Research Goal
To identify and design a robust, user-friendly strategy for enabling basic offline logging functionality and seamless, reliable data synchronization when an internet connection is restored. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity, preventing data loss, and providing a smooth user experience regardless of connectivity, especially for users logging ciders in remote locations or areas with poor reception.

### Specific Questions to Answer

1.  **Offline Data Storage & Performance:**
    *   What are the most suitable local database solutions for React Native that can efficiently store structured data (cider logs, user profiles, game progress) and potentially large binary data (photos)? (e.g., Realm, SQLite, AsyncStorage, WatermelonDB).
    *   What are the performance implications and limitations of chosen local storage solutions, especially concerning read/write speeds and memory footprint for a growing collection of cider logs and associated images?

2.  **Synchronization Mechanisms & Data Integrity:**
    *   What synchronization patterns are most appropriate for this app to ensure data consistency and prevent data loss? (e.g., last-write-wins, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), custom conflict resolution logic).
    *   How will data changes made offline be tracked and reliably merged with the remote database (Supabase) when connectivity is restored? Consider mechanisms for change detection and efficient data transfer.
    *   What mechanisms will ensure data integrity and prevent data loss or corruption during synchronization, especially in scenarios of intermittent connectivity or app crashes?

3.  **Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
    *   How will conflicts be detected and resolved when the same data is modified both offline and online? (e.g., automatic resolution based on timestamps/heuristics, user intervention for critical conflicts, server-side conflict resolution).
    *   Are there specific data fields (e.g., battle results, quest progress, cider ratings, Fellowship Count) where conflict resolution is more critical and might require different strategies?

4.  **User Experience in Offline Mode:**
    *   What is the minimum viable functionality required when the app is offline to ensure a positive user experience? (e.g., logging new ciders, viewing existing logs, limited search/filtering of local data).
    *   How will the UI clearly communicate the app's offline status, pending synchronizations, and any potential conflicts to the user without being intrusive?

5.  **Performance & Battery Life Optimization:**
    *   How can synchronization processes be optimized to minimize battery drain and maintain app responsiveness, especially when dealing with image uploads?
    *   What strategies can be employed for background synchronization versus foreground synchronization, and how can we manage network usage efficiently?

### Purpose of this Research for Design & Specification

This research is absolutely critical for the core functionality and reliability of "The Fellowship of the Cider" app. It will:
*   **Technical Architecture (`functional_specification.md` Section 16 & `03_Design/01_Architecture_Design/`):** Directly inform the choice of local storage technology, synchronization libraries, and the overall data flow within the app, ensuring a robust and resilient system.
*   **Data Storage Strategy (`functional_specification.md` Section 16.3 & `03_Design/01_Architecture_Design/03_Data_Architecture.md`):** Define how data will be managed across local and remote stores, including strategies for data integrity and consistency.
*   **User Experience & Trust:** Ensure the app remains functional and reliable even in environments with intermittent or no internet connectivity, which is crucial for a logging app used in diverse real-world settings. A seamless offline experience builds user trust and reduces frustration.
*   **Functional Specification Refinement:** Provide concrete details for the "Offline Capability" and "Data Sync" requirements, translating high-level needs into implementable solutions.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Address potential data loss or corruption scenarios, which are paramount for a personal logging application.
