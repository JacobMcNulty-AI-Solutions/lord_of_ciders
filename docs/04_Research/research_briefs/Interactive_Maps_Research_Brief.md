# Research Brief: Interactive Maps Implementation

## Project Introduction: The Fellowship of the Cider - An Epic Journey of Cider Discovery

"The Fellowship of the Cider" is not just another logging app; it's a **gamified mobile application** designed to transform the simple act of trying ciders into an **epic medieval fantasy adventure**, deeply inspired by the rich lore of **Lord of the Rings**. Our core vision is to create a compelling, long-term engagement loop that encourages real-world cider exploration while providing a rich, immersive experience.

**Core Purpose**: To be the ultimate personal cider logging and documentation app, evolving into a comprehensive "cider dictionary" and gamifying the discovery process through unique mechanics.

**Key Gamified Mechanics**:
*   **Cider Logging & Rating**: Document every cider with detailed notes and a unique "tankard" rating system.
*   **Rarity System**: Discover and collect ciders across tiers from Common to Mythical/Artifact.
*   **Battle System**: Engage in "Pokemon-style" turn-based combat against "Orc beers" using your collected ciders.
*   **Quest & Achievement Systems**: Undertake weekly challenges and earn prestigious titles and rewards.
*   **Seven Rings of Cider**: Progress through a unique "ring" system tied to geographic exploration, style mastery, and battle victories.

This research is foundational to building the immersive and rewarding experience we envision.

## Research Area: Interactive Maps Implementation

### Research Goal
To identify the most suitable React Native map libraries and implementation strategies for creating the "Map of Adventures" (personal logging locations) and "Map of Origins" (cider production regions). The goal is to ensure rich interactivity, customizability to fit our medieval fantasy theme, and optimal performance for a growing collection of data.

### Specific Questions to Answer

1.  **Map Library Selection & Evaluation:**
    *   What are the leading React Native map libraries (e.g., React Native Maps, Mapbox GL JS, Google Maps SDK for RN) that support both iOS and Android, and offer the necessary features for our specific map types?
    *   Which library provides the best balance of features (custom pins, heatmaps, polygon rendering), performance (smooth panning/zooming with many data points), ease of customization (theming), and community support/documentation?
    *   What are the licensing implications and costs associated with each potential map provider (e.g., Google Maps API keys, Mapbox pricing tiers)?

2.  **Customization & Theming for Medieval Fantasy:**
    *   How can we implement highly customized pin styles for different venue types (pub, home, festival, restaurant) on the "Map of Adventures," aligning with our medieval fantasy aesthetic?
    *   What are the capabilities for creating visually appealing heat map overlays to show most-visited cider regions, potentially with custom textures or color gradients?
    *   How can regions be colored dynamically based on data (e.g., quantity tried from each area) on the "Map of Origins," and can we render custom geographical boundaries if needed?
    *   Can we implement custom map styles (e.g., parchment textures, hand-drawn aesthetics, custom icons for points of interest) to fully immerse the user in the app's theme?

3.  **Data Integration & Performance Optimization:**
    *   How will cider location data (GPS coordinates for "Map of Adventures," origin country/region for "Map of Origins") be efficiently loaded, clustered, and displayed on the maps, especially as the user's collection grows to hundreds or thousands of entries?
    *   What strategies can optimize map rendering performance and responsiveness, particularly when dealing with many custom pins, complex overlays, or dynamic data updates?
    *   How can we effectively implement the "Visual journey timeline connecting locations chronologically" feature, ensuring it's performant and visually clear?

4.  **User Interaction & Feature Implementation:**
    *   How will tapping on pins intuitively display ciders tried at that location, potentially with a mini-gallery or list?
    *   How can "Undiscovered territories" be clearly highlighted for quest inspiration on the "Map of Origins," encouraging exploration?
    *   What are the best practices for handling user gestures (zoom, pan, tap) while maintaining custom overlays and ensuring a fluid user experience?

### Purpose of this Research for Design & Specification

This research is absolutely critical for delivering a visually rich and highly interactive experience in "The Fellowship of the Cider" app. It will:
*   **Technical Architecture (`functional_specification.md` Section 16 & `03_Design/01_Architecture_Design/`):** Directly inform the selection of core mapping technology and its integration into the mobile app's architecture, including considerations for performance and data handling.
*   **UI/UX Design (`03_Design/03_UI_UX_Design/`):** Provide the technical feasibility and limitations for designing the interactive map interfaces and their visual elements, ensuring they align with the app's unique medieval fantasy theme.
*   **Functional Specification Refinement:** Provide concrete details for the "Interactive Maps" (Section 13) and its integration with cider logging, quest systems, and the "Ring of Origins" progression.
*   **User Engagement & Immersion:** A well-implemented and performant map feature will significantly enhance user engagement by visualizing their personal cider journey and inspiring further exploration, deepening the app's immersive qualities.
