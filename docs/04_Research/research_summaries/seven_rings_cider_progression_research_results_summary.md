# Summary: Seven Rings of Cider Progression System Design

## Key Findings
This document details the design for the "Seven Rings of Cider" progression system, balancing long-term engagement with realistic cider consumption patterns. It outlines ring categories, progression pacing, special powers, rewards, and principles for avoiding burnout.

-   **Seven Ring Categories**: Each ring represents a different aspect of cider exploration and mastery, with four tiers (Copper, Silver, Gold, Mithril) and numerical targets:
    1.  **Explorer's Ring**: Geographic diversity (5-75 regions/countries).
    2.  **Artisan's Ring**: Style mastery (8-120 different styles).
    3.  **Warrior's Ring**: Battle victories (20-500 victories).
    4.  **Chronicler's Ring**: Logging consistency (7-365 day streaks).
    5.  **Collector's Ring**: Rarity hunting (5 rare + 2 epic to 100 rare + 50 epic + 25 legendary + 10 mythical ciders).
    6.  **Celebrant's Ring**: Seasonal events (3-50 seasonal + 2-20 special events).
    7.  **Scholar's Ring**: Total experience (50-1,200 total ciders logged).
-   **Progression Pacing**: Designed for early game momentum (quick wins), mid-game depth (strategic choices), and late-game prestige (mastery demonstration), using variable ratio reinforcement.
-   **Special Powers & Rewards**: Each tier unlocks cosmetic status symbols (ring icons with effects) and functional battle benefits (multiplicative bonuses, critical hit chance, defense, health regen, encounter rates, power multipliers, stat boosts).
-   **The One Ring Ultimate Achievement**: Achieved by reaching Mithril in all seven rings, completing a hidden quest, and defeating a boss battle. Unlocks significant permanent bonuses and New Game+.
-   **Secret Legendary Quests**: Ten post-One Ring quests for continued engagement (e.g., "The Shire's Harvest," "Paths of the Dead").
-   **Integration with Existing Systems**: Synergizes with the battle system (passive multipliers, special moves), quest/weekly challenges (ring-focused dailies), and analytics/Palantír features (progress forecasting, comparative analysis).
-   **Avoiding Burnout**: Emphasizes respecting player agency (no time-gated content, multiple approaches), maintaining achievement significance (quality over quantity, clear value), and fostering intrinsic motivation (knowledge, personal growth, exploration).

## Actionable Insights for System Design

1.  **Implement All Seven Rings**: Develop the backend logic and frontend UI to track progress for each of the seven ring categories across its four tiers. Ensure numerical targets are configurable.
2.  **Integrate Ring Progress with Core Actions**: Automatically update ring progress based on user actions:
    -   **Logging a Cider**: Updates Explorer's (region), Artisan's (style), Collector's (rarity), Scholar's (total count), and Chronicler's (streak) rings.
    -   **Winning a Battle**: Updates Warrior's Ring.
    -   **Participating in Events**: Updates Celebrant's Ring.
3.  **Dynamic Battle Bonuses**: Implement the functional battle benefits as dynamic multipliers or unlockable abilities that apply based on the user's current ring tiers. This provides tangible in-game advantages.
4.  **Visual Progression**: Design distinct visual representations for each ring tier (Copper, Silver, Gold, Mithril) and integrate them into the user's profile, battle screen, and other relevant UI elements.
5.  **Milestone Celebrations**: Implement in-app celebrations (visual effects, notifications, pop-ups) for achieving new ring tiers or significant progress milestones to provide positive reinforcement.
6.  **Analytics & Reporting**: Develop a "Palantír" section within the app to display detailed ring progress, forecasting, comparative analysis, and an achievement timeline, enhancing user engagement and self-reflection.
7.  **Design for Long-Term Engagement**: Ensure the progression system encourages continuous play without feeling like a grind. Provide varied goals and allow players to focus on rings that align with their playstyle.
8.  **The One Ring Implementation**: Plan for the ultimate achievement, including its specific requirements (all Mithril rings, hidden quest, boss battle) and the powerful, permanent rewards it bestows.
9.  **Post-Game Content**: Design and gradually release the "Secret Legendary Quests" to maintain engagement for dedicated players who have achieved The One Ring.
10. **Clear UI for Goals**: Clearly display the current progress and next milestones for each ring to motivate users and guide their actions.
11. **Data Model for Progression**: Create a user progression data model that stores the current tier and progress for each of the seven rings, along with any unlocked bonuses or cosmetic items.
