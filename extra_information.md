Should the data sources and rarity system emphasize global cider coverage or prioritize specific regions (e.g., Europe, North America)?

Are you open to using paid data sources/APIs, or should the focus be on publicly accessible data only?

Do you have any preferred technologies or platforms for the database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firebase, AWS RDS)?
