This directory contains the planning and research documents for a mobile application project called **"The Fellowship of the Cider"**. The project is a gamified cider logging application with a medieval fantasy theme inspired by Lord of the Rings. The documents outline the app's functionality, theme, and the research that informs its design.

## Key Files
