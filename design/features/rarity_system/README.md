# Rarity System

This document outlines the design of the rarity system.

## Rarity Tiers

Ciders are categorized into the following rarity tiers:

*   **Common** (Green)
*   **Uncommon** (Blue)
*   **Rare** (Purple)
*   **Epic** (Orange)
*   **Legendary** (Gold)
*   **Mythical** (Rainbow/Prismatic)
*   **Artifact** (Cosmic/Shifting Colors)

## Rarity Database System

*   A comprehensive, hardcoded database of known ciders with pre-assigned rarities.
*   When a user logs a cider not in the database, they can assign a rarity, and it will be added.

## Rarity Battle Benefits

*   Higher rarity ciders have access to more powerful evolution tags.
*   Mythical and Artifact ciders have significant advantages in battles.
