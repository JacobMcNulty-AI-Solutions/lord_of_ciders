# Battle System

This document outlines the design of the battle system.

## Campaign Structure

A tiered campaign where the user's ciders battle against "Orc beers".

*   **Tier 1: "The Shire Invasion"**: Introductory battles.
*   **Tier 2: "The Wild Lands"**: Medium difficulty battles.
*   **Tier 3: "The Black Gate"**: Difficult battles requiring synergy.
*   **Tier 4: "Mount Doom"**: The final boss battle.

## Enemy Types

*   Enemies are themed as "Goblin Beers", "Orc Warriors", and "Uruk-hai Ales".
*   Each enemy has different strengths and weaknesses, requiring strategic team building.

## Battle Mechanics

*   **Pokemon-style Turn-Based Combat**: Users select a team of up to 6 ciders to battle against enemy beers.
*   **Turn Options**: Attack, Defend, Switch, and Tag Synergy.
*   **Attack Types**: A variety of attacks based on cider characteristics like sweetness, complexity, and origin.
*   **Resurrection System**: Defeated ciders can only be revived by re-logging the same cider in real life, which grants them a permanent stat boost.

## Battle Rewards

*   Winning battles progresses the user through the campaign.
*   Unlocks special battle-related Evolution Tags.
*   Contributes to the Ring of Conquest.
