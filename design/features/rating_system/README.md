# Rating System

This document outlines the design of the rating system.

## Tankard Rating Scale

*   A 1-10 scale using "Tankards" instead of stars.
*   Visual representations of tankards change based on the rating:
    *   1-3: Wooden peasant mugs
    *   4-6: Iron tavern tankards
    *   7-8: Silver noble chalices
    *   9-10: Golden royal goblets with gems

## Special Tankard Types

In addition to the standard rating, special "Achievement Tankards" can be earned and displayed next to ciders. These are awarded for milestones, geographic achievements, seasonal bests, rarity, social context, and other quirky accomplishments.

### Examples of Special Tankards:

*   **First Discovery Tankard**: For the very first cider logged.
*   **Century Tankard**: For the 100th unique cider.
*   **Hometown Hero Tankard**: For the highest-rated cider from the user's home region.
*   **Crystal Tankard**: For ultra-rare finds.
*   **Fellowship Tankard**: For ciders best shared with friends.
*   **Legendary Mithril Tankard**: Reserved for perfect 10/10 ciders.
