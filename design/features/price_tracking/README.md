# Price Tracking System

This document outlines the design of the price tracking system.

## Price Data Structure

*   For each cider, the application will store an array of all prices paid for it across all logs.
*   The system will automatically calculate and display the minimum, maximum, and average price for each cider.

## Price Analytics

The system will provide the user with insights into their purchasing habits:

*   **Personal Value Insights**: Identify best value ciders (high rating, low price) and overpriced disappointments (low rating, high price).
*   **Cider-Specific Intelligence**: Provide context-aware price information, such as comparing the current price to the user's historical data.

## Achievement Integration

Achievements will be awarded for price-related accomplishments, such as finding a cider for a price lower than its average or logging the same cider at multiple different price points.
