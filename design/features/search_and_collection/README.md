# Search & Collection Management

This document outlines the design of the search and collection management features.

## Filtering & Sorting

A comprehensive set of filtering and sorting options will be provided to allow users to easily manage their collection.

*   **Filters**: Name, Brand/Producer, Fruit, Rating, Venue, Rarity, Region/Country.
*   **Advanced Filter Combinations**: Users will be able to combine filters to create complex queries.

## Collection Display Modes

Two display modes will be available:

*   **Card View**: A "Pok√©dex-style" grid of large photo cards.
*   **List View**: A compact list with smaller thumbnails, allowing more ciders to be visible at once.

## Search Functionality

*   A quick search bar will allow for live filtering of the user's collection.
*   A special "Battle Team Builder" search mode will be available for selecting ciders for battle.

## Duplicate Prevention

The system will prevent duplicate entries by checking for existing ciders by name when a new one is logged.
