# Evolution Tags & Synergy System

This document outlines the design of the Evolution Tags and Synergy System.

## Tag Categories

Ciders can earn "Evolution Tags" based on how they are consumed and their history in the app. These tags provide bonuses in the battle system.

*   **Context Tags**: Based on where and how the cider is consumed (e.g., "Home Guardian", "Tavern Warrior").
*   **Mastery Tags**: Based on the user's collection progress (e.g., "Style Master", "Regional Lord/Lady").
*   **Battle Experience Tags**: Based on a cider's performance in battles (e.g., "Battle-Tested", "War Veteran").

## Synergy Combinations

Combining ciders with specific Evolution Tags on a battle team can unlock powerful "Synergy Combinations", providing significant bonuses.

### Examples of Synergy Combinations:

*   **"Veteran" + "Fellowship Bearer"** = "Brotherhood of Steel"
*   **"Regional Lord" + "Style Master"** = "Ancient Knowledge"
