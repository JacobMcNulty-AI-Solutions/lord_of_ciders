# Achievement System

This document outlines the design of the achievement system.

## Achievement Types

The system includes both visible and hidden achievements.

*   **Visible Achievements**: These are displayed to the user with progress tracking. They are typically for major milestones and progression goals (e.g., Ring progression, number of ciders logged).
*   **Hidden Achievements**: These are surprise discoveries for quirky or unusual actions (e.g., rating a cider 1/10, trying the same cider in all four seasons).

## Comprehensive Achievement Categories

Achievements are grouped into the following categories:

*   Geographic Mastery
*   Style & Production
*   Rarity & Prestige
*   Social & Context
*   Dedication & Loyalty

## Battle Enhancement Achievements

Certain achievements will provide tangible benefits in the battle system, such as attack bonuses or the ability to see enemy weaknesses.
