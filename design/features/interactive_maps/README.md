# Interactive Maps

This document outlines the design of the interactive maps feature.

## Map of Adventures

*   A personal map that displays a pin for every location where the user has logged a cider.
*   Pins will be styled differently based on the venue type (pub, home, festival, etc.).
*   Tapping a pin will reveal the ciders logged at that location.
*   A heat map overlay will show the most-visited cider regions.

## Map of Origins

*   A map that shows the origin locations of all the ciders in the user's collection.
*   Regions will be colored based on the number of ciders tried from that area.
*   "Undiscovered territories" will be highlighted to inspire future exploration.
